The course is split in two parts:
1. *micro-econometrics*: about the analysis of agents behavior, understanding how they interact with each other and especially the causal relationship between the events and how they respond to them.
2. *macro-econometrics*: about understanding, looking at data, how the economic policies actually influence the economic landscape
